# Julie-JS-Project45-Number-Guess-Speech-Recognition

This game is based on the Traversy Media course, 20 Projects with Vanilla JS.

I am adding the following enhancements:

1. Create a start game function with button that changes its label from start game to play again
  (remove the window.location.reload method that Brad originally used).

2. Limit the number of guesses to 5, hard coded.
